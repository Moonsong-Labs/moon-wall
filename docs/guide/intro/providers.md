# All About Providers

## What are providers? 

Providers in the context of Moonwall assume the same identity as providers in the greater blockchain development space. A provider is a tool that allows you or your application to connect to a blockchain network and simplifies the low-level details of the process. A provider handles submitting transactions, reading state, and more.
