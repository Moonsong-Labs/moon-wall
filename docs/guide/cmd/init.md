# Init

The moonwall `init` command walks you through a step-by-step process to setting up your `moonwall.config.json` file. 

The command takes no parameters but you'll be asked for the following to complete the setup of your `moonwall.config.json` file. Press `enter` at each step to accept the default parameters or enter your own at each step. These parameters and their default values are listed below: 

- Label: *moonwall_config*
- Global timeout value: *30000*
- Environment Name: *default_env*
- Path for where tests for this environment are kept: *tests/*
- Network Foundation: *dev*
- Would you like to generate this config? (no to restart from beginning) (Y/n) *Y*

For more details about configuring your `Moonwall.config` see the [Quick Start Guide](/guide/test/quick-start).
